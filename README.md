## 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to the **Data Structures & Algorithms repository**!
This project provides clean, organized **C language implementations** of fundamental DSA topics. It is designed to help students and developers **learn, practice, and understand** algorithms through practical code examples.

## 📘 Project Summary

The repository is organized topic-wise, with each directory focusing on a particular **data structure or algorithm**.
Every section aims to make learning easier by combining:

* Well-written C programs
* Clear inline comments
* Demonstration of essential operations

## 🧠 Folder Details

Each topic folder typically includes:

* One or more **C source files**
* A `README.md` (if available) explaining:

  * The concept behind the data structure or algorithm
  * Program logic and flow
  * Sample inputs and outputs


## ⚙️ How to Execute the Programs

### 🔧 Requirements

* GCC compiler
* Basic knowledge of C programming

### ▶️ Steps to Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Kavish-Nag/DSA.git

# Move into the desired topic folder
cd DSA/Single_Linked_List

# Compile the program
gcc filename.c -o output

# Run the executable
./output
